# INSTRUCTIONS

**1)** Unzip server.zip file after downloading this and place server.bat file in your java web project folder parallel to WEB-INF folder. For example, if I am working on project named 'lab9', then I'll place server.bat file at this path (according to my machine).
C:\Users\0xnull\apache-tomcat-10.1.10\webapps\lab9

**2)** After runing this server.bat file, it will compile all java files, then start tomcat server and then open index.html file in your default web-browser. **Note that, if there is no index.html file in your project folder, it will show you a 404 error. Then, in the browser's url, manually type the name of the html file. ** So, always try to name the home page of your project as index.html.
